# PhonePe Credentials Issue Resolution

## ‚ùå Current Issue

You're getting a **"KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED"** error from PhonePe API, which means your merchant credentials are not authorized on PhonePe's system.

### Your Current Credentials:
- **Merchant ID**: `SU2504031614305961509257`
- **Salt Key**: `87edfc9d-a2a6-476d-8018-9bf9fcf3cb8d`
- **Environment**: Pre-production (`https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/hermes`)

## üîç Why This Happens

1. **Account Not Activated**: Your PhonePe merchant account might not be fully activated
2. **Wrong Environment**: Credentials might be for production but you're testing on preprod
3. **API Access Not Enabled**: Your account might not have API access enabled
4. **Incomplete Onboarding**: KYC or documentation might be pending

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Immediate Solution (For Testing)
**Use Cash on Delivery for now** - Your application will continue working with COD payments while you resolve PhonePe credentials.

### Long-term Solutions

#### Option 1: Contact PhonePe Support
1. **Email**: [merchant-support@phonepe.com](mailto:merchant-support@phonepe.com)
2. **Provide them with**:
   - Your Merchant ID: `SU2504031614305961509257`
   - Request activation for API integration
   - Ask for sandbox/UAT credentials for testing

#### Option 2: Check Your PhonePe Dashboard
1. Login to your PhonePe Business dashboard
2. Go to **Developer/API Section**
3. Check if API access is enabled
4. Verify if your account status is "Active"

#### Option 3: Use Different Environment
If your credentials are for production, try changing the base URL in your `.env`:

```bash
# Change from preprod to production
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api.phonepe.com/apis/hermes
```

#### Option 4: Request Test Credentials
Ask PhonePe for dedicated test/sandbox credentials:
- Merchant ID for UAT environment  
- Salt Key for testing
- Confirmed working API endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Steps

### 1. Verify Account Status
Contact PhonePe and ask them to verify:
- Is your merchant account fully activated?
- Is API access enabled for your account?
- Are the credentials valid for the environment you're using?

### 2. Test Environment Switch
Try switching between environments:

**For Testing (Current)**:
```bash
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/hermes
```

**For Production**:
```bash
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api.phonepe.com/apis/hermes
```

### 3. Request New Credentials
Ask PhonePe for fresh credentials with confirmed API access.
