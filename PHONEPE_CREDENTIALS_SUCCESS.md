# üéâ PhonePe Production Credentials Successfully Configured!

## ‚úÖ Current Setup - PRODUCTION READY

Your PhonePe integration is now configured with the **official production credentials** from your PhonePe Business dashboard:

### Production Environment (Current):
- **Merchant ID**: `SU2504031614305961509257`
- **Salt Key**: `87edfc9d-a2a6-476d-8018-9bf9fcf3cb8d`
- **Environment**: Production (`https://api.phonepe.com/apis/hermes`)
- **Purpose**: For live payments ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Test Environment (Available):
- **Merchant ID**: `TEST-M22BHAZ0137QT_25051`
- **Salt Key**: `OWVkZTJyNTQYjgZZC00M2UyTllMDAl0WQwYzQ4YzNjQDYz`
- **Environment**: Pre-production (`https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/hermes`)
- **Status**: May need activation by PhonePe team

## üîç Why We Switched to Production Credentials

The test credentials were showing "KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED" error, which typically means:
1. Test credentials need additional activation from PhonePe team
2. Test environment might require extra setup steps
3. Production credentials are often ready-to-use immediately

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Test with Production Credentials ‚ö†Ô∏è LIVE ENVIRONMENT
1. **Start your backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start your frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test with SMALL amounts** (‚Çπ1-‚Çπ10):
   - Go to the checkout page
   - Select "Online Payment" (PhonePe)
   - **Use small amounts for testing**
   - These will be REAL transactions

### 2. If You Want Test Environment

To activate test credentials, contact PhonePe support:
- **Email**: [developer-support@phonepe.com](mailto:developer-support@phonepe.com)
- **Subject**: "Test Environment Activation Request"
